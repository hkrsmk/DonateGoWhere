    "Objective": "=DREAMS Singapore is a secular, co-ed weekday residential model that provides after-school education and holistic support, =DREAMS aspires to create a child-centric holistic system of care.  \r\n\r\nAn initiative by the South Central Community Family Service Centre, =DREAMS empowers promising and deserving children who come from low-income households to break out of poverty and dream of a future where they are not limited by their family circumstances.",
    "VisionMission": "ABOUT US\r\n\r\nWHAT: =DREAMS is a residential model that provides after-school enrichment and holistic developmental support so that each child can focus on meeting their potential for a tertiary education. \r\n\r\nWHY: While 90% of Singapore’s households live in homes of their own, families living in public rental housing may need socio-economic support, including help with their children’s development. =DREAMS seeks to provide opportunities to the aspiring children of these families, some of whom may be 2nd and 3rd generation occupants of public rental homes.\r\n\r\nWHO: To qualify for the programme, the child should minimally have passed the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and received entry to a Secondary School. \r\n\r\nHOW: Successful applicants will benefit from the programme for up to 6 years, from Secondary 1 to Pre-tertiary. Children will stay in =DREAMS during the school week and return home over the weekends and school holidays. During the week, they will commute to school themselves and return after the school day ends where daily support with school work will be provided. Families can look forward to all-rounded enrichment for their children under =DREAMS, as developmental and differentiated programmes such as coding classes, eco-citizenship cultivation lessons, leadership and critical-thinking-focused training, will be incorporated into their schedules and offered during term breaks. We will partner with parents and community to encourage integrated care and foster the kampung spirit. \r\n\r\n=DREAMS will be funded through donations and in-kind sponsorships. We are currently in the process of selecting a venue for the facility and hope to secure one by the second quarter of 2021 for intake by the end of 2021.",
